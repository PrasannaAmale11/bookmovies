<h1>Show Booking App</h1>
<p>It was a task given by QuadB Tech organization to test my skills for a ReactJs Developer in which I have to retrive data from API: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all </p>
<h5>Requirements</h5>
<p>need to create a basic UI to display the show names and a few details about it. Include a button for each of the shows to redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of the particular show. It has to have 2 screens at a minimum. One to display a few data and possibly an image and another screen to show itâ€™s summary.</P>
<p>The second screen should have a button to book a movie ticket which will open a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details.
(Reload should not happen)</P>
